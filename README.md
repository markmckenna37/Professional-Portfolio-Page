For this project we were tasked with making updates and adjustments to our 2nd homework assignment: responsive portfolio.
Updates included adding a link to the PDF of my resume, changing about-me content to include a brand statement, and adding links/screenshots for my projects.
Adjustments included fixing Bootstrap responsiveness, changing background colors, and adjusting picture sizes.
